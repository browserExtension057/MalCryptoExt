Turns out the page was in separate container than the last time I had allowed those permissions. The permissions are *CONTAINER SPECIFIC*. I hadn't really properly put Multi-User Container add-on really to good use!Now I don't lose permissions. I can have certain (all possible to keep things working) Google servers blocked on default - same with any FaceBook servers. In fact, FaceBook servers are only allowed on FaceBook container. And if a site that does not belong to YouTube container, but needs to show video from YouTube, I either temporarily allow the servers, or I move the site into YouTube container; which needs a good good reason if it's not a Google's YouTube services. OR, I'll add another container for pages that don't need all the YouTube and Google servers allowed, but need to have just those allowed that let the videos roll; and move that site there. This is in fact incredibly great way to work, although I still miss the Legacy version - I will soon try changing to a fork that has all the modern support of FF, and support for legacy add-on's.

Maybe 10.1.9.4 has to be run more than once for its fixes to the 10.1.9.2 bugs to take effect, and these are only  picked up on browser re-start?

All issues have been verified by disabling NoScript: without it no issues occur, with it enabled all occur, so it is the sole cause.First, after a while, as others have reported, Firefox just stops working and will show nothing. From the console, it looks like NoScript has broken the Firefox origin policy on everything. Where is it trying to import scripts from?The problem, reported on the NoScript forum that pages on local disks are broken since 10.1.9.2 on Firefox 61.0.2 remains. The scripts (used to) run but incorrectly also showed the content of < noscript >. A moderator proved this with a use case but the report has now been deleted. In Firefox 62.0, it is now worse. The page may load once (incorrectly) if you are lucky, then if you reload it stops (previous point). There is no facility in the current UI to specify permission for local pages (I think there was before the big change to the Firefox api)Somewhere, probably in 10.1.9.2, the user list of allowed and blocked sites has been corrupted. 10.1.9.4 was supposed to fix this and recover the situation but hasn't [on the first or second runs].As you just seem to delete some issues reported on your forums, please don't ask me to post there.

The new interface is Terrible to put it mildly. Its over 'simplification' and design has produced a bewildering experience that makes ones head ache in a state of near vertigo when first used. Just to add insult to injury, as previously stated, you will probably have repeat the process when the settings are forgotten.No script has always been annoying when visiting a site for the first time. Identifying the minimum scripts allowed for site functionality whilst blocking the rest, was a tedious process but it was offset by the fact it only had to be done once. The result was a huge dividend of security, privacy, speed of page load, reduced memory usage and increased stability to the browser as a whole from avoiding execution of unnecessary and in many cases poorly written, bloated code.In short the new NoScript is a horrible disappointment, in stark contrast to the wonderful browsing experience of Firefox 57\"At that time I felt the review was completely justified.But, there is hope!The UI is improving and in some ways, superior to the old which I think we all have to agree was a bit clumsy.I understand now the 'forgetting' of settings directly attributable to the API changes in Quantum and Mozillas role in it and the unfair but understandable scorn from users like myself who have become accustomed to features being removed and UI changes from likes of Microsoft and others in the name of 'progress' and our willingness to unload both barrels as a result.I persisted with noscript, temporally allowing just about everything, relying on Sandboxie protection.It improves with every update to my everlasting gratitude and I cannot wait for the day I rate it 5 stars!THANK YOU to the developer(s) for all of your hard work and persistence in the face of mounting criticism from people like myself.No Script is in my opinion a vital extension for security, privacy, stability, user control and the enrichment of the browsing experience...", "", "", "Thank you for the interface changes!

It's as good as it was before. :)", "My comments were removed. I'm not sure about the reasons.I switched back from ScriptSafe + Netcraft extension to NoScript for about a week. Overall, I think the current version of NS is quite smooth to use. The current UI is understandable but it is still far from perfect. However, I think it is worth to trade some convenience for better security.I have the following suggestions for NS. Some of them were suggested before indeed.1. Include a button to allow all scripts globally in the main UI. Sometimes when we do something really important, such as making a payment online, we would like to allow all scripts globally and temporarily. Having the button in the main UI would save us a few seconds each time. In contrast, the button \"Temporarily allow all this page\" has very little practical use in my opinion.2. As some other users pointed out, get rid of the \"slider\" thing. It takes up too much space so it makes the list of scripts unreadable. It also makes the position of the buttons not consistent.3. The list of scripts can be sorted in a better way. List the blocked scripted at the top and the allowed scripts at the bottom.Overall, I think the current version of NS is much better than 2 months ago and it does what it is supposed to do now. NS seems to be the only firefox addon which provide protection beyond blocking javascripts. It worth 4 or 5 stars in my opinion.

Lets not forget, that thanks to Giorgio's time and effort over the years, many thousands of surfers, me included, have been protected from who knows what was lurking behind some scripts.Why not cut him a little slack, even such as the mighty Microsoft, Google, Apple and such others put out buggy stuff and that's with their thousands of programmers and millions of pounds!So why have I given it two ( for the time being ) stars.Mainly due to two things.One, to me very important, there not being available, from the day it came out, any decent instructions in layman's terms, as to how to use it, I'm reasonably computer savvy and can normally get my head around most things, eventually, but this had me going spare, marking sites as trusted then having them revert to untrusted after shutting down and re-starting was a real pain, until I discovered only this morning, whilst reading these revues, that a simple click of the little clock solved this problem, thanks to those who mentioned it.The second reason was because of the initial buggy nature of the first release.Will I continue using it, of course.Why, simply because, even as it is, I can't find another program that is as good as this one and going by past experience it will settle down.Thanks Giorgio", "There is a problem with the settings.

Click the clock again to make it go away and make the \"trusted\" status permanent.  Then there is the \"untrusted\" button and the \"custom\" button.  The custom button allows you to choose what elements are allowed.Knowing how to use the 2 buttons, the \"trusted\" and \"untrusted,\" and the temporary button should help clarify this extension's usage and make it usable again to everyone.

First you need to accept that the current approach is simply not intuitive.

Simpler might be less safer, but if the alternative is not using it at all, it's still better. Way better.- get rid of the slider. It looks mhm good(?), but its not recognizable as one.- there is way to much clickable stuff, one does not get what is a button, what a link and whatnot...- make it simpler: hide everything exept: domain name, status icon and -depending on the status- two buttons for each entry.- clear design, dont change font size and font color at any time- No xss-popups. In fact, never, ever use popups.Instead:- a simple list of domains like before, each with a status icon in front of it: your blue \"S\", for allowed, same with a little clock for temporarily allowd,  red crossed \"S\" for disallowed - depending on the current status of an entry, two buttons: - if currently allowed:  \"disallow\" and \"temp. disallow\" - if currently disallowed:  \"allow\" and \"temp. allow\"- these buttons need to be different than the status icon. I would use red X and green hook/check, each with and without a little clock.- dont make anything but the buttons clickable! not the text, not the status icon. Thats it. You can add a (clearly seperated from the other buttons, clearly different graphic) button behind each list entry to hide all the detailed settings, for the expert. Everybody else gets the simple list. At the very buttom of the list go -clearly separated - three entries: \"temp allow all\" and \"save permissions for this site\" and \"deactivate noscript\".No problem to do that in html.

There are two aspects to it that I can see: the script blocking operation, and the UI. Some sites that I visited no longer work with NoScript enabled, even if you allow everything. Amazon music (play sample) didn't work for me, just one example. So that needs sorting out.As for the UI, I initially found it complicated and confusing but I am getting used to it now. What happened to the middle-click functionality?But until the developer has managed to fix the functionality, I have to disable it. I may just end up using the Brave browser until it is fixed.Oh, and I would like a way to save my Whitelist so that I don't lose it if I uninstall and reinstall.", "Wow, what went wrong?

Works for me so far. One thing I found a bit tricky is that if one allows a script from a non-https site but without also allowing non-https from the site by clicking on the padlock, then reloading will show the site as \"Default\", i.e. most of the time as blocked. So it seems as if the allowing of the site was not remembered by no script. I think it would be better to show the site as allowed as one has chosen before since the padlock will give you the further information that it does only allow non-https.I have seen lots of people saying that no script does not save allowed sites. So far for me the workaround was always to unlock the padlock as well.", "Ottima Estensione fa quello che dice, purch\u00e8 si capisca come lavora e la si configuri correttamente.", "This was a five-star add-on prior!

Maybe the developer could implement very quickly a joker system allowing to enter domains like :*.akamai.net*.hd.akamai.netIn first case we allow every subdomain of akamai.netIn the second case we limit to every subdomain of hd.akamai.net2) No synchornization optionIdeally, NoScript should store the users data in cloud through the Firefox account as ScripSafe does in the Google Account.But maybe it is not possible according to the Firefox account policy, so the workaround should be to be able to synchronize data to/from a local path on the computer.One just have to create this path in a OneDrive or Google Drive synchronized directory...and this should be done.I have several computer, each computer has several users session, this is just annoying to set up NosSript for each repeating always the same process. And when I set up a new computer, I must restart from the beginning.With ScripSafe, this is very easy... the extension automatically download and upload to Google Accounts (one must activate such option).If ScripSafe is ever ported to Firefox with the same functionalities, I drop NoScript3) Slow GUIAs today, the NoScript GUI is I N C R E D I B L Y slow.As a comparison ScripSafe is incredibly fast to display the distant hosts listBut this version is a kind of quick done dirty version, let's be patient, this will be probably fixed in the future, but developer must know that the situation is as today not acceptable. I also suspect that NoScript 10  slows down the browser4) Inefficient filtering mechanismIn the former XUL extension, the filtering engine of NoScript was crappy as it was oftenly forgetting a lot of distant host.So one needed sometimes to switch to \"allow all scripts\" to see these hosts, and go back to \"forbide all scripts\", and so we could set rules for theses invisible hosts.As compared, ScripSafe was far better as there was not such issues.Finally.... XUL NoScript is dead and this is a very good thing because the filtering engine of NoScript was outdated and the author didn't want to admit that.Let's see now if this brand new Web Extension addresses such issues, I can't say at this moment.", "Best stuff you can have on Firefox.

The UI is not fully developed and looks like it was made for newbies than for experienced computer users. I know, the UI cannot be changed back. We all will have to accept that XUL is gone. I don't think, the new UI is bad in general. It is just not finished yet.Sadly, some very important features are still missing. For me personally, giving temporary permissions to a website is a must-have feature. I think this is such a key component that I wonder why it has not been implemented yet. How am I supposed to test a website? Giving it permanent permissions and later revoking them again is not a very effective way.There are still a lot of things to be done.

For sites, which you visit very often, you'll have to find out the proper script-configuration.Some scripts will only appear after you allow another one (I'll call them \"tier-2 scripts\"). Some sites do even work, if you activate first the tier-1 script, than tier-2 and then (!) deactivate the tier-1 (or many others, which you just need to activate the \"hidden\" script), then everything will work!

The average user will either hate it, not understand it and / or not understand why many of the websites they visit simply don't work or don't display the information they expect. For me (and I'm very IT lierate), that makes NoScript unusable. The straw that broke the proverbial camel's back was that it wasted several hours of my time because it was blocking crucial functionality on the web interface of my Synology NAS drive, even though I had supposedly white-listed the site. By pure luck I tripped across a post by another Synology user who had experienced something similar. Whilst I'm glad that my NAS drive UI is in fact working as intended, I'm mildly p'd off that it was NoScript that caused the problem, despite my best efforts. I strongly suspect that 'the average user' would not have solved the problem and would still, understandably, be scratching their heads. I won't go back to NoScript as, IMO, it's a step too far and interferes with 'normal use' of the Internet. I'm sure I'll get slammed for this 'negative' review but the intention is to explain why I'm criticising it, offering some words of extreme caution. You'll note that I've left the star rating 'down the middle' at 3 stars as some credit is probably deserved for the overall design of the software and the maintenance frequency. I'm also not going to say here what I'm using as an alternative - I'm not here to promote alternative products. I would strongly recommend that anyone reading this thinks carefully about what level of security is really appropriate for your use of the Internet.

I only want it to speed up webpages. Don't particularly care what it does and does not display. The problem isn't with Noscript it's with the fact that most webpages are SO heavily embedded with javascript it's essentially impossible to do anything w/o turning it on. And On And On. 3 or 4 or 5 layers of recursive javascript are the norm now - just to do something stupid like print a page or have the layout in a readable format. So by the time you figure out the one or two entries you should turn on...screw it...turn them all on. Which leads me to my two main problems: 1) have a feature where ALL is ALL no matter how many layers down they are. ALL - really ALL. and 2) turn everything on PER TAB and ONLY per tab.

You can configure it to auto-allow scripts for any web site you visit, while denying 3rd party (usually advertising) scripts.

If you want to load an element using a plug-in, simply click on the NoScript icon inside the web page to temporarily allow.Important: If you do not like to think about web browsing and want things to \"just work\", this may not be the add-on for you. It requires that you are somewhat conscious of what you are doing, but the benefits can be worth it.For the average user, the hardest thing to get used to is how NoScript's menu seems to display script permissions in \"reverse\". In other words, the icon of an \"S\" with red slash through it indicates what WILL happen if you select that option. The main icon button, meanwhile, displays the current permission(s) for that site and any 3rd party elements. I have often wished for a toggle feature to reverse the menu icons. :)For the advanced user, you can explicitly deny all and create a custom \"whitelist\" of the sites and servers you need access to. To be fair, this method can be challenging to manage and sometimes requires a little deductive sleuthing to determine which 3rd party sites/domains are needed for some of the more script-happy places out there. But you can always quickly select \"temporarily allow all (on) this page\". NoScript will then delete any \"temporary\" site permissions when you exit Firefox.I salute and thank Mr. Maone for this outstanding tool!TIP #1: Be sure the NoScript icon is on your Navigation Toolbar for quick monitoring and changes.TIP #2: When you first install NoScript, check the settings for the built-in Whitelist as it includes common sites that you may not require and can remove.

To those I would say that security and convenience have always been polar opposites. The more secure something is the less convenient it is, and vice versa.

To get the function I am speaking of AdBlock+ needs to be installed (unless I am missing something). With AdBlock+ you can use \"Open blockable items\" and view any *.js files available for blocking/unblocking once you enable scripts with NoScript. This is fine because then one can use AdBlock+ to block a specific .js file if needed. The point I am making here is I feel if you are going to announce <#of> scripts/objects blocked then there should be a way to view what they are in-case a user does not use AdBlock+ or want to (beyond me why someone would not).Additionally, I would love to see NoScript incorporate a similar feature like RequestPolicy does. If there is a script being run from another source other than main site I would like to see the following: Allow Scripts from 3rdPartyscript.com to maindomain.com or Allow request from maindomain.com to 3rdpartyscript.comPersonally I think ABP, NoScript, and RequestPolicy need to merge in some way along with possibly BetterPrivacy.

Works exactly like it should.", "This is a very nice add-on helps me lot in web browsing.", "It's a good add-on and works well. However, there are two things that irked and confused me. First of all, the developer whitelists his own websites. That's giving his relatively unknown (I've known deviantArt and a lot of other websites in his whitelist before, but not his) websites a special status on many people's computers, namely that he can run JS on them by default, which most other websites can't. He argues on his FAQ that he with NoScript already has code running on my computer so I should trust him, but I don't agree with this argument. What if someone gets in on his server and puts malicious code on it? That's no longer about how much I trust him then. You say that won't happen? Well, I say the same about my website. Also, I trust that mozilla peer-reviews submissions, and thus he doesn't dare putting anything bad in. I don't necessarily trust his websites. Last but not least, I think a security related application should come with the minimum possible whitelisting. I want it \"secure by default\", and not stumble upon a FAQ entry telling me \"hey, by the way, my own websites are whitelisted by default and if you don't like that, you have to remove them\". He also argues that frequent updates are critical for security related applications, and I agree with that - but why \"go soft\" when it comes to his own websites and start \"making exceptions\"?Second, I found some UI elements confusing, in particular the \"Allow Scripts Globally\" warnings. After reading them, I am not sure - do they mean that NoScript will behave as if it wasn't installed? Or does it mean that scripts get even more privileges than that? The \"Dangerous!\" warnings seem to imply the latter. Rewording the warnings might clarify this a bit. The review from January 23, 2011, which apparently had no effect, probably says it better than I do - from the wording, it feels like it's going to override my browser security settings, and not just disable NoScript. Because of that, I'm not sure whether it's okay to \"Allow Scripts Globally\" for a while, or whether that's going to do more than disabling NoScript, and as a result I have temporarily disabled it.

I suppose I could go to the author's website and read up on it - he surely must have some info there, one would presume, but I haven't got around to it yet...

You can export/import your backup file to any location of your choosing, and you can name the file whatever you want to make it easy for you to recognize later.Also, as others have said, NoScript is one of the main reasons I use Firefox... well, NoScript and the other add-ons listed below too :)____- Firefox 3.6.x on Linux.- NoScript plays nicely with the other add-ons I use:- The add-ons I have installed are, in alphabetical order: NoScript, RequestPolicy, Small Screen Renderer, User Agent Switcher, and WebDeveloper.", "A must have for Firefox users.", "Thank you very much!", "Add-on is great, there it is not blocking the download window automatically opens the file in some website.", "perfect, i love to use it", "One of my must-have plugins.

All I can say is that this extension works brilliantly for me and exceeds all my expectations.While it requires your approval/decision on which scripts to allow every time you visit a \"new\" site, it does remember or \"learn\" your settings so that you don't have to re-input for your routine sites. Some may find this a hassle, but if you have ever been infected with a rootkit virus, lost all your files and spent untold hours/days/weeks debugging/reinstalling/rebuilding your PC's OS, software, Documents, files, etc., then a couple seconds of prevention before entering an unknown website is a small price to pay my friend.However, if you are less concerned with preventive security and would prefer to not be bothered with script management tasks while surfing, I recommend that you look at the reactionary \"YesScript\" add-on instead.If you don't understand what scripts are consider spending an hour googling up some info on the subject. If you do, I guarantee you that you will install this add-on immediately and use it from now on (plus a basic understanding of scripts will lend to a better understanding of how to operate this add-on).After using this add-on I cannot conceive surfing without it. Nor can I comprehend how anyone (who understands it) could give it anything under 5 stars and a glowing review.Two Thumbs Way UP!!!!and a big thanks to the designer(s)!", "Excelente, me sinto mais seguro no firefox agora.", "if you care at all about your networks security, this extension is an absolute necessity, the user interface can be a bit confusing at times, but once you get the hang of it, its plain sailing", "waou !!! excellent boulot ! noscript c reprendre le contr\u00f4le du surf ! il fait ce qu'on lui demande et c'est top ! chapeau !", "Don't surf the web without it.", "excellent one!", "Awesome addon that's helped me avoid adware and other nasties more than once.

However, only tweak any settings if you know what you are doing.Unfortunately the user interface, especially of the preferences dialog, is quite complex and designed for experts rather than normal users.

I'm sure it very often blocks scripts I don't want, but how often does it block something truly malicious?  The \"Temporarily Allow All\" button is absolutely critical.  I don't know how I ever lived without it.  But you still have to click the Temp All button for just about everything.  In fact, you have to click the button multiple times for many sites.  It may be because a site is drawing scripts from different domains for each page image.  Either way, it has become horrendously irritating dealing with NoScript, but I'm still afraid to get rid of it.  I may run a test on a linux machine with only AdBlock Plus (which does a wonderful, totally unobtrusive job) to see if I can live without NoScript.  I'm getting close to the point of thinking that I can.  I'm just so tired of having to dick around with every single page.I've also taken to allowing all top-level domains.  That helps a lot.Second, I agree that there are way too many updates.  One update a week is fine, but NoScript seems to update all daily -- many of these are tiny, incremental fixes.  We don't need a new version deployed every single time some little thing is changed.  Has anyone had a compromised machine because you were 0.0.0.1 version from the latest?Overall, it's recommended only for very advanced users.

", "Re MimiFa's 01/16 \"Good and Bad review\" - The whole point of NoScript is to be protected from the sites that _aren't_ ok.  To not use NoScript because most of the websites you visit \"are likely ok\" misses the point of the tool entirely.  Web attacks are the vector of choice today, and NoScript is possibly the most important tool one can use to avoid them.  Literally millions of users run on compromised systems in bot-nets today, with their owners not having the slightest idea they've been taken over... which makes them a threat to others.  These days, it's naive, and arguably irresponsible to _not_ use NoScript.  Sites that are \"likely ok\" can easily be added to the whitelist, while still letting NoScript protect from the unknowns.  However, many scripts that sites want to run on one's system have nothing to do with the functionality of the site and can be left turned off.Re the idea of just blacklisting - Blacklisting assumes the user can stay aware of every bad site on the planet.  With more popping up daily, maintaining a meaningful blacklist is difficult at best.

Many legitimate websites, though lesser known, use scripts that are meant to help you or improve your browsing experience. For example, some sites detect what browser you are using so that the site can serve you the appropriate content. Other sites use scripts to allow dropdown menus, and such. These innocuous scripts are blocked.  Some addons also used scripts that won't work because they are being blocked.So, for me, I tried NoScript for a while but then realized I just don't need it.

How do I do that?Obvious ad-oriented sites are easy to pick out, \"mark untrusted.\"  Far, far too many sites have benign names whose purpose I can't begin to determine.

Here's what I have to say about it:NoScript has several layers of blocking intrusive elements in webpages, including ones that anti-virus solutions cannot block as of yet. It has the ability to block scripts, ActiveX controls, Flash/Silverlight plugins, and even cookies from being installed on your system without your knowledge AND permission, so this way, it ends up working better than any other solution to date in keeping those unwanted addons off your personal space! I will admit myself that the benefit of this is NOT just in theory, since it actually saved me from such intrusions at least several dozen times since I picked it up about seven months ago. Another feature of note here (and also the one that made me dump IE for a Gecko-based browser) is one that blocks all sorts of zero-day hijackings and exploits that IE and all browsers based on its code tend to get torn to ribbons by, including clickjacking, cookie hijacking, fake-HTTPS related attacks and other such constructs commonly used by scammers. Now, about the functionality for blocking scripts and other such site objects: when certain site script URLs are brought up in the XSS blocking popup, I would recommend looking up the script's ratings in MyWOT or a similar resource before enabling or disabling it as part of your whitelist (just type in the URL of the script into the search box at the top of MyWOT's webpage). If you would be so inclined, though, you could just enable the script of the page that you are viewing and NOT any other scripts from outside, since oftentimes, webpages do NOT require scripts from other URLs to retain all functionality, unless they are subdomains of the script's webpage. The only thing I can see that would be desired, though, would be the functionality for placing sites in a blacklist to accompany the whitelist, so that those sites will NEVER load under any conditions unless you say otherwise. At that, it would also be desirable to have this setup so that such domains could blocked (and all of their objects coming from them!) WITHOUT having to visit them directly, even though I do know that Firefox provides blocking of URLs out of the box. Overall, after extensive testing of the addon, I have yet to run into any sort of severe problems with it. I sure hope Giorgio and crew intend on keeping in mind the suggestions of those who use their NoScript tool, since doing so would only stand to make it better than how it already is!

It you were being shown what exactly was being blocked, it wouldn't be blocked.Nice useful tool without having to set browser to block all java, which can trace you etc. Select where you want, and need to use it.Very nice website NoScript has too.

Absolutely necessary for everyone.", "I like NoScript.  However, it has some shortcomings that I feel need to be addressed.Primarily, I want the ability to review all potentially dangerous scripts on  a page before running them. NoScript will not post specific scripts on a web page if you are blocking that site.  On the \"blockable elements on current page,\" ironically it will only show elements on the page that you are currently *not* blocking.  All specific javascript js files are not shown if they are being blocked.  So I might be blocking an entire website, but I don't know specifically which scripts I am blocking from that website.For example,  try visiting mycokerewards.com (it will probably crash Firefox).  If you have not allowed mycokerewards.com, it will show a list of blockable items on the current page, but none of them are the elements which cause the page to crash Firefox for me. In order to see the elements which cause the page to crash, you have to \"allow\" mycokerewards.com, and once you do that, I get a spinning PWOD (beachball) and Firefox stops functioning and I am never able to see a list of blockable elements, including the scripts which are causing the page to crash.  This for me is a fatal flaw in an otherwise great program.  I do run NoScript and will continue to.  However, if you come across a website that is unusable, for the average user like me, it is not possible to see all dangerous elements without unblocking the site and then by the time you have the chance to try to view them, you get a nonresponsive browser, nonresponsive NoScript, and no updated list of blockable items so you cannot try to figure out the culprit.  I would like to be able to slowly add one dangerous script in at a time to a troublesome page, to see if I can isolate which scripts are causing the site to crash Firefox.  NoScript works for pages that don't cause Firefox to stop functioning, but it does not work for sites that cause Firefox to stop functioning.  And there should be the ability to view *all* blockable elements on a page, including the ones that are currently being blocked.  I should not have to \"allow\" certain sites in order to view more blockable elements on the page.  They should all be viewable to me and I should be able to control all of them.  Control should not be given to me only after I have allowed the website, for by then if the website crashes Firefox it is too late.", "I'm still telling it which sites to allow and forbid and it's starting to move more into the background of my surfing.  One feature I would like to see is the ability to click on a site in the menu and be able to learn about it.  I'm unable copy and paste the names, so I'm forced to go to my bookmarks, open WOT, and type any questionable sites in (hoping to type it perfectly).  It would be nice to be able to right click and instantly receive the info I need to decide what to allow or forbid.  Overall it works exactly as I would expect.  Thanks!!", "If you understand what a script is, this extension is a must-have that will make the web much safer and more pleasant to use.If you don't understand how HTML uses scripts, NoScript can cause problems ... but NoScript is so good that it's worth taking the time to learn how to use it.

I like to block Java and Silverlight on all sites, (trusted/nontrusted), a placeholder for Flash on all sites (trusted/untrusted) and for PDF allowed on trusted sites and placeholder on all others.That is not possible at the moment.

While going through the payment form I realised it was blocking the website, so I unblocked it, then I realised it was blocking my BANK! I had to disable NoScript just to complete the payment process. This add-on always blocks websites by default, there isn't even a filter list to subscribe to such as on Adblock Plus, in fact, Adblock Plus has a filter list that blocks tracking anyway so I fail to see the usefulness of this script. Why do I have to manually add websites to my whitelist? NoScript should be intelligent enough to recognise when something is to be trusted or not. All it does is slow down my browsing when I have to keep adding websites to my whitelist. I really can't recommend this add-on but to a select few with extremely low-end pc's. Otherwise, stay well clear.

This is the *first* add-on that I install. In fact, I manually install it globally such that all Firefox profiles on every computer I'm responsible for automatically have it. Good security practices demand that one begins with \"deny all\" and then whitelists. NoScript is the near perfect tool to apply this principle to JavaScript, Java, Flash, etc. I find that a majority of websites work without enabling such scripting. With all respect to Giorgio, NoScript functionality should be integrated into Firefox, but I am exceedingly grateful to Giorgio for filling many of the security voids as yet ignored by Mozilla developers. You may have read about the recent skirmish between Giorgio and Wladimir Palant. It is true that Giorgio did wrong, but the problem did not result in user harm and was quickly corrected. Wladimir and Ares2 also did wrong, but they and their childish pitchforks and torches mob threaten your personal security when they imply or say outright that you should not use NoScript. I strongly recommend you *never* surf the web without NoScript installed and working properly. Yes, it does impose a small requirement that you understand its basic purpose in order to use it, but the effort really is trivial and you will be making a truly *huge* improvement to your security. Note that ad blockers like AdBlock Plus are *not* substitutes for the kind of security provided by NoScript. In fact, ABP is not a security tool at all. If you want to block ads, use ABP for what it's good for, namely cleaning up your visual experience on the web. Better yet, use an alternative ad blocker that isn't polluted with venomous personal political agendas of the sort Wladimir and Ares2 engage in. Whatever you do, use NoScript.

", "Something that really should be installed by every Firefox user.", "I have been a Firefox user since the days of 1.0, and two of the very first extensions I have installed are No Script AND Ad Blocker Plus.Used together, these two extensions can make your surfing considerably more safe; but you can not treat this combination as \"set and forget\". For some, this may be acceptable, if your surfing is relatively limited. But, if you are like me, and access content from all over the world; you need to apply common sense.First of all, I consider anything served by a web site to be \"content\" and that does include scripts. Specifically, I use Ad Blocker Plus to prohibit loading \"any\" content from some sites. Here are some cases to point out what I am trying to express. On April 1, 2009, I reset the \"hit counter\" for all sites under Ad Blocker Plus 'preferences' menu. You can see just how much \"stuff\" was attempted to be loaded from these sites. These sites are COMPLETELY blocked:site                                    hits since April 1, 20092o7.net                                           1042 doubleclick.net                              35210google-analytics.com                      1656googlesyndication.com                    1139mginteractive.com                         63962Because I use a limited bandwidth connection, I let ABP prevent the wastage of my bandwith by all kinds of junk. Then, I use No Script to setermine which scripts are allowed on the sites that I do visit. No Script allows me a more finely grained ability to control whose scripts that are run.One of the other features of No Script is its ability to stop XSS (Cross Site Scripting) attacks. Web sites that pull content from anywhere in the world are potential exploits, just waiting for the unwary to visit. Then, bam a \"drive by\" and your machine is 'owned'. You may trust the actual site that you visit; but how can you be trustful of all of its 'partners'? You never know which of them are hosted on some 'cheap @$$' content delivery network that is poorly administered. No Script can reduce the risk.I have read many  comments about the \"No Script - Ad Blocker Plus \"controversy; and I feel that both sides need to take a \"chill pill\". This kind of ego stroking does not do the Firefox community, as a whole, any good.In the five plus years that I have been using Firefox; the only time i got hit, was once when I was using one of the Firefox 3 betas; and No Script was disabled because it was not updated to work with that version.

The only places I allow permanently are local scripts like configuration scripts (for example of my router).If one really is disturbed by always blocked scripts, one should reflect about the meaning of the term 'security' and the personal skills around this topic. If you, pezzonovante, are experienced enough or you dislike such blocking, why do you install NoScript?There are lots of users who desire this kind of security and know very well what they want to allow to run (and that is - for sure - less than 50% of all scripts on the average of pages out there) on their machines. NoScript gives us the ability to choose the level of security according to our 'feeling'. Those, who are permanently annoyed can simply uninstall NoScript, so no necessity of such strange modifications like that one you told - I don't like such rare experiments.

It takes less than two seconds to allow Java from sites you trust, and you can choose to permanently allow sites you visit regularly.

As NoScript stands, everything is good until you block it.  Once you've stated your choices, it doesn't came back and bug you any more.  The reason it happens so often (up front) is because you're running into new turf.It's like firewalls: there are two types: everything is open until you close it. Everything blocked until you open it. Which is easier to maintain? Most people who aren't long-termers on the systems side will say everything is good until you say it's bad.  This puts the burden upon you to block the troublemakers.  If it's blocked until you open it, the only holes in the system will be the ones you punch.NoScript takes the first view - notify, but verify.  As I said, if it blocked until you opened, you'd be just as disappointed in the beginning until you punched holes as you need to.You think answering NoScript is bad?  Think about what Vista does. It's a pain the tokus. But people screamed about the lack of Windows' security.  It's no more effective, but if someone yells about it, they can ask, \"Which way do you want it? Block or no block?\" (that's a yes/no question, no room to provide semantics.  If you don't like NoScript, don't use it.

As I was having lots of problems, however thanks to a few posts, the discussions and reading from top to bottom of Giorgio Maone's help site at noscript plus messing with about:config I have finally sorted this out to work perfectly! Thankyou, apologies and I am off to browse safer PLUS eat my own words *ouch* my pride dented a bit but oh well, I felt I had to amend this to be fair and honest!", "I think it is very balanced between security without freedom and freedom without security. After a few day of intensive \"learning\" the addon becomes almost unnoticeable. I use it about two years. Greate work!", "I don't know why some people are to lazy to just right click, and turn this certain page on.  This has saved me from countless spyware.", "I got this extension primarily to block those irritating roll-over popups, but it quickly turned into overkill as most webpages these days use javascript, only a small percentage of which are malicious. Nearly every webpage I loaded I had to allow scripts for it to function properly. It was click this one to allow js, it still doesn't work, click this one, still doesn't work, etc. It was even more bothersome than IE's yellow \"security bar,\" \"are you sure? click here,\" \"are you positively sure?\" etc. Even after allowing them all sometimes the webpage wouldn't fully load, probably because of caching. After a couple weeks I got frustrated and set it to allow all scripts and am going to uninstall it.Adblock Plus works just as well, isn't nearly as intrusive and I'm able to block rollover popups with just a few clicks.", "I love the fact that everything is blocked and I only have to tell it once to allow what I want.Sure ad scripts won't harm your computer, but they sure are annoying. If you ever visit any crack sites, you will know what I mean. With NoScript, I can visit those sites, get what I'm looking for and when I scan my computer with several adware/malware scanners, they don't find anything, not even cookies.So yes, this tool is useful, because even with adblock, if you visit a site with this crap all over it, you will still get stuff installed on your computer until you decide to block it with adblock, but with no script, that stuff never shows up.", "You're either being naive or covering up for your deficiences as a developer. Scripting does have I'm a Web Dev too and I run NoScript. However Web 2.0 your site may be, it should still have a javascript-off fallback - you know why? Search engines. Accesibility. Phones. And NoScript users! JS is great, but in a web 2.0 world it's for usability *enhancement* only - the site should work without.I agree with other comments that a whitelist would be nice. Otherwise - what a great tool!", "This addon really shows you how many scripts a web site runs when you visit their web site. Allows you to select only the necessary scripts to run. Very frequently updated.", "I like the idea of NoScript, but it quickly became  blocking overkill. I ended up removing the program.  Almost every page has scripts on it somewhere and having to constantly allow them became tedious after a while, especially when some pages won't even open until you allow the scripts. Even my firewall and cookies settings aren't that stringent.  Just as I don't want to approve each and every cookie, I don't want to have to approve  each and every script. I agree with others, an on/off feature would be nice.  I generally know when I am foraging into dangerous territory where I might encounter harmful scripts and need to block them. But generally speaking most scripts I encounter aren't harmful and anything put onto my computer by them are quickly disposed up via my spyware/adware programs.Or a feature whereby the program can intuitively identify harmless scripts and automatically allows them globally so I am not constantly having to allow them on every site.", "I use this all the time, but I'm starting to learn when I don't need it. The thing I like best about NoScript is that it shows non-developers all the scripts on a page, so you *learn* which script name goes with which banner or whatever. For example, a TV network home page often has 5-6 scripts for external ads, individual show info, etc. I don't want all that junk running all the time, but I'm not sure which scripts control which boxes without NoScript! If I exclude or allow a script, I can see which adverts, etc. it blocks. Yet, I can tell NoScript to allow the top level URL, and it \"remembers.\" One suggestion is to stop the slide-up notifier on sites I frequent--especially if it's the same group of scripts. THANKS! Your Results May Vary. cheers.", "...this extension quickly becomes a hassle since most pages have legitimate scripts that are needed to view or navigate them properly. Since the default setting is to block everything that hasn't been allowed explicitly, you quickly find that most pages stop working. Something's got to change here. Hey, why don't you make it like AdBlock: allow scripts by default and let the user ban and whitelist various URLs, or create a subscription service that blacklists unwanted script sites. Or how about this one: create and on/off button like Adblock, so you quickly can turn it on when you know you're going to a suspicious site.The basic idea of NoScript is very good (FF users needn't be quite as worried by scripts as IE users), but the usability of it is what has got to improve.", "It seems the only people to say 'don't use this' are developers that wish to throw ads in your face - with no-script you can actually allow the site you're viewing to use java but keep google and all the other ads etc blocked without turning off java altogether - its a winner in my opinion!", "This is by far the best extension for FireFox!", "With NoScript + Adblock Plus = Ultimate Protection.", "It adds to the protection of Firefox, I was worried about the cross scripting issue but I was already using NoScript, so I was glad to hear I had been protected already! When I have to do a reinstall (due to my failing PC) NoScipt is the 1st thing added on, then AdBlock Plus. Had no issues bar one small past issue which you fixed within a day or so, it does not get the way of my browsing or slow it down any. It does not interfere with any of my security apps on my pc. The only thing is my AntiSpyware apps are feeling a bit left out since I started using FX and this, hardly any just a couple of minor tracking cookies. Job well done! Many thanks for making browsing a pleasure again!", "Best extension ever. Perfect control over what content to allow, this with ABP and your set.", "Before noscript was around there were a lot higher incidences of malware on the company networks I help to keep running. It takes very little time to explain to people how to use it and under what circumstances they should whitelist sites. I make a list of sites I want to blacklist and then use the firewall to prevent all access to them - sites that contain whenu and zangocash etc. every now and then I check all the browsers to make sure people arent whitelisting sites that are dangerous or similar to spyware - I hate google-analytics and block all of their stuff - this is the best bit of security a company can have since most intrusion is brought in these days through a browser or via email - there is nothing dodgy or malfunctioning with this software its 100% brilliant", "For your next update/release, you should add the ability to allow all javascript just for a single page/tab.

And give a shot to Kee. Even if I miss some of its excelent predecesor Keefox I must say that it worth to use (much better than KHPH). The explanatios of Luckykrat are very comprehensible explaining the limitations that are not on him but on Mozilla itself. The only thing is that I notice that Kee is also putting its icon into fields which are not for logins or pwd. For example in the AirOs page of my Nano5 I got the icon in the Mac address field and in the access point field where is not needed to be. I guess that Kee sees those field as login-pwd ones. Anyway I don't care for that (the icons are pretty, though :-). So 5 stars to Kee, and encouraging the Autor to keep improving it. (I have updated it to the newest version, but I don't see any visible changes yet).1 Problem: If I check \"...automatic login\" in Options, when I close  (log off) a page, as it returns to the login page, Kee keeps login again... I had to uncheck the (convenient BTW) option box and manually do login. What can it be done to fix this?2 Problem fixed: I was seen in some secundary pages the Kee icon in some places it shouldn't be (I guess Kee was seen that as login/pwd) and even in a particular page the whole thing started to blink o tremble in a way I couldn't do nothing to stop it. I solved the problem opening and editing the connection login and in the last \"Kee\" tab, in URLs set as \"Exact: The Url must match exactly including full path and query string\" and then, in the additional frame I added the exact url of the main page (where the real login/pwd is). After doing this (and save the change!) I didn't see the icons in the secondary pages again.", "I've been using KeePass for years, and this extension makes using in Firefox a great experience.", "It's all free!

No mater what machine I go to all my passwords and logins are at my finger tips. Note you must run KeePass with Mono outside of Windows.You have control of your password security. Not counting on a third party to store your passwords securely. I recommend saving your KeePass database to a small USB drive and attaching it to your key chain to have your passwords with you at every machine you work on. Keep a copy of KeePass Portable on the drive as well, and take advantage of Firefox Sync to sync the Kee Plugin to all your machines.KeePass has a great password generator that supports various password requirements. Unfortunately the Kee Plugin does not fully support all options in the KeePass password generator, so occasionally I have to Alt-Tab from Firefox over to KeePass to generate a new password. Maybe Luckyrat in his spare time can expand the password generator support? :)", "Works but the password generator is pretty bad.

Overall it's a nifty addon but buggy, for instance I have it installed yet the addons page says I don't... unfortunately passIFox got abandoned so there are not a lot of alternatives.Reply: well, if you're about to or already did rewrite the code then the argument is valid. I would have expected a bit more. My internet banking page for instance uses a sensitive frame to login, if that frame is not submitted properly the whole process fails, but KeeFox does not understand to look inside the frames of pages for fields, even with different sub-domains, it just covers the top page. PassIFox managed that, but now I'm off Chrome, on to the e10s FX and it's not compatible. Also by poor coding I mean you focus on other things like browsing the db instead of first making sure your addon covers all scenarios for filling fields and then do other things once the main function is working fully. Luckily I can use autocomplete, but what's the point of the addon then? And there are a lot of other pages, top documents, on which it doesn't want to autocomplete... not even to list logins in the right click menu.

I know that they can be turned off, but are they really that helpful to beginners to justify nagging others by turning them on by default?In summary, what can be done by the developers to get a better rating:* Let KeeFox latches behave like any others in Firefox: close them automatically as soon as the user clicks anywhere else.* Look at how PassIFox detects and fills forms, and improve the form-filling logic.

Uninstall PassIFox first.First, the good:I've been looking for a good alternative for LastPass for a while. Specifically, I've had the need for a password manager that allows me to share certain passwords with certain groups of people (Co-Workers, Spouse, etc.), but I didn't want to pay for the LastPass group features. KeePass allows me to segregate passwords into individual databases that I can control sharing contexts. KeeFox then allows me to access all of the open databases simultaneously.Now on to the shortcomings and caveats:The UI integration could be just a bit better. For example, I'd like to see a LastPass-ish type context menu on login fields offering logins for the same or similar URLs. Same goes for an option to manually save fields on the page.Also, there is apparently some issue with saving/filling JavaScript forms. The end result is that KeeFox isn't as reliable as LastPass in detecting and filling forms. The developer has mentioned in the forums the technical hurdles to this, which seem to boil down to concerns about improperly filling a form. I'd prefer if an option were offered to at least attempt to fill JavaScript forms without a submit action.Lastly (and this isn't really KeeFox's fault), if you have tried out PassIFox, remove it. PassIFox disables the built-in Firefox password manager. Disabling this intereferes with Firefox's built-in Sync, and also with KeeFox's KeePass authorization key storage. KeeFox will properly turn off the built-in password manager in a manner that allows both Sync and KeeFox to work correctly.", "Great Work - I Just wish it could become discrete and like a small button (Like Lastpass) and not occupy a whole toolbar area.

So far i see its potential and really want to love it but theres just somethings about it i see need to be added to be a true LastPass replacement, and those are:-A way to make it work without having KeePass constantly open. Nowhere does KeeFox's documentation say KeePass needs to be open too for the addon to work, and it took me ages to realize thats whats needed to make use of this. If possible if it could work with KeePass not being opened too itd be better.-A narrow toolbar that only appears when asking you what login details you want to use on a site (for times when you have more that just one account on a site) similar to the one of LastPass, that and the ability to set which one should it fill in by default. Currently the only way to currently do this is to have the toolbar or icon of KeeFox always viewable.-Ability to detect what databases KeePass currently has. So far (not sure if bug possibly) KeeFox will list old databases that dont exist and theres no way to remove them from the list at all. Not even if you uninstall Keepass and KeeFox.-Since KeeFox can detect when theres a login field it should have in the context menu an option to generate a secure password from there (but to be only available in Firefox's context menu when a login field is detected and not constantly there)-On some sites it fills in the username but not the password, however Lastpass can somehow, for example on redtube it will fill out the username but not the password, perhaps it has something to do with sites not allowing a password to autocomplete? (by default Lastpass has a setting that prevents sites from doing that so that it can still fill in the password)Aside from those issues, this is a top notch addon, seriously i cannot believe  this isnt integrated into and part of KeePass as most passwords are used on websites and the current way that KeePass works with browsers makes most people not want to use a password manager in the first place lol.", "Never a problem on each Platoform/OS I use: Firefox on Windows in two different places and Android on different phones!

Although it can be customizable, it would be nice to change the default UI of the plugin to something more elegant, while still retaining full functionality and ease of use.3. A better explanation of the options and the use of the KPRPC JSON file: I am not sure what this file does. Sometimes keefox recognizes login details from Keepass and works without storing this entry in keepass string fields. When keefox saves a login/pass info from Firefox to keepass then it always stores this entry.

I have resorted to disabling the extension and enabling it only when I have a need for one of the functions.While Symantec does provide a significant suite of products in their Norton Security package (including virus protection, firewall, browser safety, password security, random password creation, VPN service and more), and has a positive image in the industry, the continuing issues with stability and slowing response makes this less desirable.My original review:I have been a long-term Norton customer, and have appreciated many of their products. However, I have had nothing but issues with the Norton Identity Safe extension. While it does appear to keep my logon information safe and secure, it slows down Firefox (and other browsers) to a crawl. Attempting to open a tab, or refresh a page, becomes a multiple-minute ordeal, with Firefox noting that Norton Identity Safe has some bad code that is causing the page to slow down (I also received the same error statement about Norton Safe Search). When I disabled both Identity Safe and Safe Search, the lag and delay stopped and Firefox was fast as lightning.I have made sure I have the most up-to-date versions of all of the above. When the most recent update of Norton Security came through (after the most recent Firefox update), I was hopeful they had fixed the issues. It did work a bit faster at first.

On my work computer i was not able to port extension from chrome and ended up copying the extension XPI from home computer to work computer and now its working again.

It would be great if the addon respected the original anchor, and if the user clicks the little blockchair icon that you insert on the page, THEN it takes you to blockchair, but otherwise it goes to wherever the original link goes.  Ideally we should be able to also disable this hyperlinking if we want.

Sometimes it is desirable after you've been browsing a while and have since visited many websites, to have a simple button to clear all cookies.

I wish all companies had the same integrity. My only concern is how small the userbase seems to be (solely judging by the downloads here in Firefox extensions). Myki deserves hundreds of thousands of users, if not millions! I hope that I don't one day lose the wonderful functionality of Myki due to their overly reasonable monetization and small userbase. If it ever came to that, I would happily pay a monthly subscription akin to the popular note-taking app Bear, which is $1.99/mo.

I feel this is one of the biggest limitations.

Such absolutism (all-or-nothing think) is rarely useful to anyone. So, first, throw out all of the 1's and 5's and dig deeper into the reviews that have actual thoughtful analysis of the product. In this particular experience, the Capital One add-on, Eno, is wonderfully useful... when it works. For me, a frequent online shopper, it provides two things I value highly: convenience and security. I love having it available at shopping sites, with all the info I need to complete the purchase. I don't have to look up my card info and manually fill it in. Very nice. Sadly, some updates to Firefox and a few sites' code break the add-on. But I've found this to be true of many of the add-ons I use. Anytime an app or an operating system pushes out an update, it's not uncommon for software that interacts with it to break or have issues. So, this is not a particular sin of this add-on. It applies to many add-ons.Most importantly, I love Eno and the feature from Capital One to use a virtual number. The add-on just makes it easier to use. One can still interact with the Capital One website to manage their virtual numbers. Due, once again to occasional breaks from browser updates or particular sites, I have had to get creative when using the feature. This can be frustrating. It's not perfect, but overall, it works more than it doesn't, and the ability to generate a one-time use number is invaluable when it comes to online security. Keep in mind, the virtual number feature is very flexible. You can keep using the number for that particular site, but lock it, so it's only usable when you allow it, you can just delete it, or leave it unlocked for one particular merchant only (e.g. for a subscription).If you're not using a virtual number, you are asking to be hacked.

But after 2 months, I have mostly changed my mind.  I'm leaving my old review below, but here is a new perspective and 3 more stars, for 4 stars total.I had no trouble installing this or using it many many times afterwards.  It has worked, as far as I can tell, exactly as CapitalOne wants it to work. It was different from my Bank of America Shop Safe, so at first I hated it.  But I have found a way to use it well.  It has a drawback I will describe, but in some ways its also better. Here is how I use it.1. Keep the extension disabled, except when you need a new virtual credit card number.  That way it cannot spy on you at every website you go to.  When you need one, enable it, get the virtual card number and record it in your password vault.  Disable the extension.  The only problem here is that you must have a website open to \"attach\" the virtual number to.  I have been able to occasionally get a number that is not yet attached to a site, but I cannot repeat it.  When I can, I will add that info here.  But you are not actually limited to that website.  You can even use the number over the phone.  It appears that the number is permanently attached to the first credit processor that uses it, like ShopSafe was.  This is very useful, because giving number over the phone to a human is much more dangerous than typing it into a computer.  (CapitalOne - Please support getting numbers that are independent of a website!!  Thanks!)Your charge goes pending at first, so you cannot delete virtual card right away.  But every time you get a new one, check for old ones that you can delete.  This was my substitute for being able to define an expiration date in ShopSafe.  Its not automatic, and you cannot set a maximum charge amount, but it seems good enough.  That said, I decided I did not actually have to delete them every time.  As long as I knew who I gave it to, if I got any bogus charges, I would know where the problem was.  And since the number is probably locked to the first card processor that uses it, it is unlikely that it could be used by anyone who stole it in an IT breach from a company where I used it.  I could probably have done this with ShopSafe too, but didnt realize it.  Now I feel comfortable using it for recurring charges also.So...I am pretty happy right now.  If I stopped being able to use a number over the phone, I would probably go looking for another credit card to replace this.  Using it over the phone is not officially supported and this is the main reason I only have it 4 stars.  The other reason is that I have to enable and disable it every time I use it.  But thats not too onerous.  Thanks Capital One!  Sorry for the misunderstanding at first....*********** ORIGINAL REVIEW ***********If you are looking for a ShopSafe replacement (recently cancelled by Bank of America) Eno based virtual credit card numbers from a CapitalOne card are not for you.  These virtual credit card numbers do not give you the same protections from online fraud and do not work the way you would expect.  First, you must use this app to create and manage virtual numbers.  There is no website that I can find.  This app is \"always on\" and watching your browsing activity to look for a site it thinks you might want a virtual credit card number for.  So your browsing activity is no longer private.  You cannot create a virtual card number until the app sees you on such a site.  I was able to activate it on a dummy site, but then it links that URL to the credit card number.   It set the expiration date of the virtual credit card 5 years into the future, oddly, past the expiration date for my real Capital One credit card.  You cannot set a virtual number to expire after a certain number of months, like you could for ShopSafe numbers.  Likewise, you cannot set a maximum charge amount for a virtual number, so anyone who gets this can charge as much as they like.  So Eno virtual credit card numbers don't protect you from an unscrupulous online vendor, like ShopSafe did.  In fact, if you read the Terms and Conditions, you will see that the virtual number may not even be locked to a specific merchant, like ShopSafe was.  They appear to be testing this, but \"...a VC# you create for use Merchant A should work at Merchant A, but may or may not work at Merchant B.\"  So in my opinion, this does not really protect me very much.  In fact, since there are no limits on the merchants and you cannot limit the maximum amount nor set a short expiration date, it may make you more vulnerable to fraud.  If someone steals a virtual number from a company you gave it to, they can use it just as if they stole a card from your wallet.  The only reasonable thing you can really do is delete the virtual number, but that assumes you know it was stolen.  We usually dont find out about that until long long after it happens. In fairness, unlike other reviews, I will say that I had no problems using my phone number to validate (via text messages) and get this set up.  Setup worked just fine.I am thinking carefully, because I really want a ShopSafe alternative, but this credit card will probably go back.", "I'm a long-time Capital One Banking customer.  After BofA discontinued their virtual credit card numbers (\"ShopSafe\") I opened a Capital One Savor One card account for the SOLE PURPOSE OF USING VIRTUAL NUMBERS FOR ONLINE SHOPPING.  After receiving the card and attempting to set up Eno I was frustrated by the inability to log into my account / verify my account, which requires the ability to receive an SMS text.  I do not have a mobile phone, and the Google Voice account that I have isn't \"acceptable\" to the Eno verification process.  Every other financial account or service that I have (and there are almost a dozen of them, not including the IRS..) allows me to verify either by a phone call, a hard-copy mailed PIN, or an email sent to the address on file.  It appears that Capital One doesn't care much about their customer's needs or requirements, since the only option being provided for Eno verification is the SMS/text of an identifier.  After an hour with Tech Support and an escalation to a supervisor I've been told \"this is the way it is\".  So non-mobile phone users are automatically excluded as Eno users.  That is blind thinking.Since I can't use Eno I've decided to open a competitor's card account (the one remaining provider of virtual card numbers), and while I'm at it I may as well move my banking accounts as well.  I already have too many accounts at different institutions.If this isn't fixed in 90 days I'll have no need for the Savor One card.  After I've earned the $150 spiff that I get for the new card I'll be closing that account.  Thanks Capital One for the $150 and for the memories.", "ENO works sometimes and it doesn't sometimes.

Eventually I \"hit the max\" and have to wait for the next day to try again (and call in again).  This is ridiculous - just got this Capital One card because BofA is getting rid of shopsafe and I rely on virtual numbers.

Especially trying to log into your account. Metamask recommends that you log out of your wallet when your not using it which is good advice as you don't want to tell everyone how much you have. However, it virtually impossible to log back into your account with a simple cut and paste of your 12 secret words and passwords. Let me explain...First you copy your 12 secret words to paste into the box. However, as soon as you click anywhere else to paste your password, the metamask window disappears. When you open it again, it's asking for the 12 secret words again. So, your only option is to paste in either the secret words or your password, not both. One of them has to be done manually to keep the window open. Another frustration I had was when I recovered my wallet after it logs me out is after I had pasted in my 12 words, it asks me to create a new password. Now this is supposed to be a strong, secure password and I like to use at least 12 digits. So I create a new password but as I type it in, all I am seeing is the common security dots so I can't see what I'm typing. This means I can't type it twice like it asks and I can't copy and paste it anywhere. The fact that the Metamask window reverts back to the start whenever I click away from it and have to open it again makes it almost impossible to use conveniently using cut and paste.One more issue I have with Metamask is, whenever I close my browser, my settings delete history and cache. This means I have to recover my wallet every time I open my browser.

Kind of ends up being user-unfriendly for those who would use in a more 'serious'/efficient capacity...My opinion, for what it's worth, is that best-practices ought to be pursued foremost, otherwise the tool becomes an interface nightmare for those who want to use it efficiently and thoughtfully. You'd end up with a better product and that's the best scenario for a creator. A lite version is perfectly reasonable once that's taken care of.I appreciate what you've done, though, and understand where you're coming from.

Whilst the reporting in the daily mail is heavily biased, this is not what newsguard claims to rate.Furthermore - rather than criticise newsguard for changing the rating for the daily mail from red to green (as they recently did), I admire their openness to change.  The mail previously rated less well for openness, probably because when contacted by newsguard originally they weren't forthcoming with the information requested, and deservedly got rated badly for openness.  Once the mail made this information available newsguard rightly changed their rating.I think the most helpful review below is unsurprisingly the most considered one, by concentricbrainwaves.  I also agree that having an amber rating would be helpful, and in the case of the daily mail, would probably be appropriate.

A third colour (Blue?) would be useful to indicate news aggregators with a legend along the lines of \"This is a news aggregation site. Please check source articles on the originating sites\".Finally, it is disappointing that a particular print-and-online \"news\" publication recently had it's rating changed from \"Red\" to \"Green\" without changing its editorial stance in any way. To my mind \"Red\" was thoroughly deserved because the publication presents opinion as if it were fact and habitually spins news to such a degree that it winds up seeming to mean the opposite of the original facts. Others will disagree with me on that assessment but independently verifiable \"facts\" are \"the news\" which the reader should interpret whereas \"opinion\" is someone else's (often malicious and politically motivated) interpretation. When opinion is dressed up as the news it is *fake news*; when a fact is twisted it becomes a lie.  If, under the colour scheme suggested above, the publication in question were to be marked \"amber\" (with straight-forward explanation) - No Red, No Green, - NewsGuard's rating would be less likely to seem biased, even to some of the One-Star Generals who, in this comment space, have denigrated this nascent attempt to differentiate information from disinformation.", "This widget requires massive amounts of work. Classifying news sources as \"outright 100% true\" and \"outright 100% false\" with their green/red mark label system is not the right way to do things.They have very complete \"Nutrition Labels\" which allow for more complex ways to classify sites, so why don't they use them?This can work but not for the time being. I highly discourage anyone from trying to get source guidance out of this widget in it's current state.Based on the forementioned Nutrition Labels, they clearly have plenty of information on the sites they rate. All they have to do is use them more openly and make them simpler for a user to understand, instead of just putting them side to side and saying \"This is great\", \"This is terrible\".", "", "Thank you for creating this add-on.

I'm using Firefox version 61.0.1 (64-bit). I am using Cookie AutoDelete extension (not with auto setting on so its not doing anything until I tell it too).

Almost. My Steam Wishlist is pretty long but only 27 games appeared on Fanaticals' Wishlist. Is that because Fanatical only sells this 27? (unlikely but possible I guess).

However Firefox disabled unsigned add-ons for security reasons. So the add-on can't be installed.9) navigate to \"about:debugging#addons\" and click \"Load temporary Add-on\". Now you can add your newly created extension and see if you did everything right.10) However after each restart of Firefox the extension will be deleted. There are multiple ways to prevent this, however none is really secure/ideal. I chose to upload the new add-on as private add-on here https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/developers/addon/submit/ . This signs the add-on officially by Firefox and only let's you download it instead of making it available for others too.11) Disable updates to the extension. (As nothing got modified in the package except the url, i am unsure how the add-on will behave if there is a new update from startpage. Either it won't install or the private search string will probably be deleted.)12) Check regularly for the official extension to be updated and include this functionality.

This is eff'n awesome!", "", "It feels strange that I'm writing this review because I was only able to use it one time, but I try to give credit when and where credit is due. Ironically enough, if it wasn't for this extension existing in the first place I would never have figured out how to download BitChute videos (without torrenting) on my own as fast as I did.As of writing this review \u2014 note the timestamp on my review if this extension still exists years from now \u2014 this seems to be the only existing BitChute download extension that can be found for any remotely popular web browser. Of course, this extension doesn't actually download BitChute videos for you directly, but it certainly does save some keystrokes and time. There are a couple of key details that interested users should note, however. First. Firefox and Bitchute, at least in my experience, don't play together so nicely. I was only able to get Bitchute to work properly on two different versions of Firefox, and on my newest version (that's compatible with this extension) it only worked once, so that I had no way of using it after that point. I'm using Brave as my go-to browser for Bitchute, but obviously I can't make use of this extension on a Chrome/Chromium-based browser either. It's a real catch 22 if I've ever seen one. Second. The author must have a different kind of keyboard because the [ ` ] key does not exist on my keyboard. Instead I have the tilde [ ~ ] key in the location where the author's key would be located. For simpler reference, it's whatever key will bring up the console commands screen when playing a PC game \u2014 usually located right above the TAB key. Something to note is that this extension seems to pull up just the first direct URL to a given BitChute video, which is fine; it's just a good idea to remember to change the seed number in the URL if it's giving you trouble, and don't forget that seed numbers 1 through 9 have zeroes in front of them (i.e. seed04 NOT seed4). Not just any seed number will work though; the vast majority of them will give you a mostly blank error page. I've only changed the seed number to something random one time to where it actually worked, so when in doubt use the alternative seed number provided in the magnet link. If neither works, you're probably better off doing something else and trying them again later unless you feel like playing whack-a-mole with other seed numbers. If so, most seed numbers I've seen provided on magnet links typically range from 03 to 28 as a point of reference. ---------------------------------For anyone who can't get this extension to work on their (current) version(s) of Firefox and still doesn't want to torrent BitChute videos, fear not. Here's a simple tutorial on how to do what this extension does with a little extra effort:Step 1   find your desired BitChute video to download, I'll be using this one as an example:https://www.bitchute.com/video/lxrI91GFQXi6/Step 2 Either left click or right click the magnet link button in the bottom right corner of the video (with the magnet icon) to get the big jumble of what looks like nonsense to copy down. On Brave (and probably other Chrome-based browsers) you have to left click and are redirected to another page (in the same tab with my setup) where you have the option to either start the torrent or copy the magnet link. Clicking the magnet link button on that new page should instantly copy it to your clipboard, if using a chrome-based browser. For Firefox or similar browsers, both left clicking or right clicking should be an option. With my setup, right clicking is faster because the menu gives me the option to simply \"Copy Link Location\" without redirecting or triggering a popup. Step 3 Paste the magnet link somewhere, like a notepad. Here's the (current) magnet link to the video I posted as an example earlier:magnet:?xt=urn:btih:e80a54f7b0f3b25e29badf4dacdbabe30aa72f3e&dn=lxrI91GFQXi6.mp4&tr=udp://explodie.org:6969&tr=udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969&tr=udp://tracker.empire-js.us:1337&tr=udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969&tr=udp://tracker.opentrackr.org:1337&tr=wss://tracker.openwebtorrent.com&as=https://seed25.bitchute.com/dMQ56bKoGtg7/lxrI91GFQXi6.mp4&as=https://seed07.bitchute.com/dMQ56bKoGtg7/lxrI91GFQXi6.mp4&xs=https://www.bitchute.com/torrent/dMQ56bKoGtg7/lxrI91GFQXi6.webtorrentStep 4  There are three segments in the cluster that end with .mp4. The first should be ignored since it's not a direct URL. Taking the entire cluster and removing MOST of the undesirable parts will produce a result like this:https://seed25.bitchute.com/dMQ56bKoGtg7/lxrI91GFQXi6.mp4&as=https://seed07.bitchute.com/dMQ56bKoGtg7/lxrI91GFQXi6.mp4Step 5 As you can see, the two viable direct URLs are right next to each other within the sequence. Delete the &as=  in between them and separate them with the return key if desired. Now you have two easy to use and viable direct URLs to the example video to download:https://seed25.bitchute.com/dMQ56bKoGtg7/lxrI91GFQXi6.mp4https://seed07.bitchute.com/dMQ56bKoGtg7/lxrI91GFQXi6.mp4Step 6  Paste either of the URLs into a tab and wait to see if a video appears on screen surrounded by a mostly black background. If the seed is \"busy\" and gives you an error message of some kind, change the seed number to that of the alternative \u2014 there's no need to copy the entire other URL since the only part that differs between them is the seed number. Again, remember that seed numbers 1-9 have a zero in front of them. Step 7 (Final Step)  Once the video has loaded \u2014 it will expand, the loading ring will disappear, and it will probably autoplay if not blocked as a function in your browser \u2014 right click roughly in the center of the little video screen and choose the option \"Save video as...\" with a \"Ctrl+S\" shortcut next to it or whatever the equivalent is on your browser or OS. You could obviously just hit Ctrl+S or whatever the corresponding shortcut on your keyboard is, alternatively. As long as don't have saving directory/download location prompts disabled on your browser, you'll have to option to choose the download location and rename the title if desired. NOTE: You can do all of this without even making a BitChute account (at least at the time of this review). What are the advantages of this method?1. It's faster than torrenting in pretty much every conceivable way, especially once you're practiced enough to train your eyes to focus on the important parts of magnet links. 2. You don't have to worry about using a VPN before downloading, regardless of the type of video (provided it's legal to watch in your country, etc etc). ---------------------------------It bothers me that I'm the first (and so far only) user to write a review for this extension. YouTube may very well continue on for years to come, but if you want to watch or listen to all of the intriguing and hilarious content that YouTube deplatforms and censors then BitChute is still the place to be. In other words, the creator of this extension has my support, if nothing else, for, in his own way, promoting the only real counter-culture alternative to YouTube.

Other free vpn I am now using has mostly good server, fast connections and MANY more free proxies, including a few residential proxies that cannot be id as a proxie. Also no arbitrary small data limits either. Windscribe used to be pretty good but has deteriorated over time.update 12/17/20: THe high star ratings this vpn gets are testament NOT to it's quality but to the very poor performance of all \"free\" vpns. When it works, it works reasonably well, but most of the time it's just FLAKY. Cannot connect because it cannot find the open browser tab even when the browser is connected to a site. Very few \"free proxies\" They make you hunt for them and their GUI is a PITA to use, slow and cumbersome. Today their servers lost my login info and I had to relogin cuz they could not recognize that I was a long time user. I wonder if ANY of these \"FREE\" vpns will ever amount to anything. Not holding my breath and from their \"FREE\" services performance, not sending them any money either.update 12/2/20: Much better last week. stable servers mostly, still hard to find the free ones requires a lot of clicks. often get the \"cannot find tab\" error requiring closing of browser ff and reloading. Connects sometimes automatically on browser open which is good. The user interface could be made more user friendly and easier to use. Takes too much time to navigate to what you want. mini popups to explain the buttons are in order.update: 11-18-20: really deteriorated, extremely slow both to connect and in data transfer. Very few free proxies, takes forever to find one. Diconnects on \"autopilot\" so even they cannot find a working proxy. Obvious they do not want free users. Had trouble connecting to make this review maybe being blocked? Another lame \"free\" proxy. BS.Better than most, BUT same as all the others-will not allow access to any website that uses software to ID proxies. None of the free vpns do this and most of the paid ones do not either. You need residential proxies for that and they cannot afford to offer that for free. So if a webpage is blocking proxies you're SOL-u will not get in. Same for sites like netflix. SO SLOW ACROSS SEVERAL PROXIES THAT IS IT ALMOST UNUSABLE. in firefox but kudos that they kept my login credentials even after over a year not using-shows they are professional.

Be very careful and install at your own risk.  By the third day, I have Re-installed Fedora 30 and Re-formatted the partitions and only installed   mozilla-noscript   from the Fedora repository and only installed   HTTPS Everywhere   from the Firefox add-ons.By the third day of testing, fiddling and using this add-on, I had lost the trust and confidence for this add-on.  My last Fedora 30 was only installed a week ago with only the default packages.  I had only NoScript and HTTPS Everywhere in Firefox that I had used for years.  Windscribe was the only extra add-on.With Windscribe:1)  By the third day, I had to enter the url at least 3 times before it start loading.  Websites kept reloading.  It was slow with this add-on ON and its was not useable.  I had to set it to OFF for Firefox to work.2)  ifconfig   showed that about 30 MiB, the total of all the   tun   and   WiFi   Tx and Rx traffic, whereas the Windscribe counter showed more than 100 MiB used.  There was no download or Video for the three days.  2.5 GiB consumed for just Text and some images in the last three days!  That is not possible.Can someone out there check what is actually going on using network tools like Wireshark, etc.?Ok.  I will do it on my own using OpenVPN and Cisco IPsec.Firefox should invest the resources to review all add-ons for all updates before allowing them to ride on its Browser as it could break its useability and much worse, plant sinister and malicious codes in its add-on.THE INTERNET IS FULL OF SECURITY FLAWS.  IT IS UP TO ALL OF US TO PUT IN THE HEART AND SOUL TO MAKE IT GOOD INSTEAD OF EVIL.  THEN THERE IS NO WAY THAT THE WORLD IS BAD FOR ANYONE.--------2 days ago reviewWow, Windscribe is really some Security and Privacy Services.  Using   sudo yum install windscribe-cli   from   /etc/yum.repos.d/windscribe.repo   was seamless.  windscribe viewlog show the line OpenVPN 2.4.7 x86_64-redhat-linux-gnu which is a native TRUE VPN which is, my desktop is connected direct to a France exit point through a VPN tunnel which is, all my desktop traffic is encrypted between any location to the exit point in France, like my actual location is in Malaysia, but my virtual location is in France.  If I use  wget  in Fedora 30, all my data traffic will go through the encrypted VPN tunnel.  I set my Firefox virtual location as Switzerland which is then a Double Hop, which is an improvement as all the Firefox traffic is encrypted to the France exit point and then the encrypted traffic is redirected to the exit point in Switzerland.  The Double Hop speed is slower, but acceptable.  Again, many thanks to the Windscibe Canadian team for producing this needed high quality internet package for the World.One good feature is that the   windscribe-cli   reconnect to the last VPN exit point at every Fedora 30 shutdown and boot up cycle.  It remember the setup parameters and connect exactly every time.  Similarly, Firefox also reconnect to the last VPN exit point in every Close and Start cycle.  In one VPN add-on that I tried, it requires me to login every time when I Start Firefox to get their VPN service.  I remove the VPN add-on immediately and add-on Windscribe.  That was when I discovered Windscribe yesterday.  After a day or so, I found that Windscribe has all that I want in a VPN service exactly and more!  It comes with Privacy on top of Security.  Is save me a lot of trouble to search and do it myself to get only 10% at most what Windscribe already has.sudo dnf update   will automatically update what is new in the windscribe.repo   .   It is best that Windscribe put the windscribe packages in the Fedora repository as an open source.  This would gain the trust and confidence of all Fedora users to install the Windscribe packages as any one can look into them for improvements and check for malicious code.   NoScript has done it.     sudo dnf install mozilla-noscript   will install from the Fedora repository since the much earlier Fedora versions.  There is no need to include the extension  NoScript  from Add-ons  .  dnf  will automatically install   NoScript  from the Fedora repository and embed   NoScript  into Firefox.   sudo dnf update will automatically update any new changes in   NoScript  onto Firefox. Again, it is good that    dnf install windscribe-cli   will do all the work from the Fedora repository as only the Windscribe development team know the best to give users the seamless process.  If Windscribe do have such a plan, please investigate the negatives in doing so.  Like, many people can break the   windscribe-cli   if too many people are involved.  Perhaps, there should be an approval process such that any new changes in the Fedora repository must be reviewed and check by the Windscribe developer before any update, big or small, can be updated in the Fedora repository.If only the Windscribe client is running in Firefox, the WiFi icon  is normal on the Fedora 30.  If both the   windscribe-cli  is running in Fedora 30   and the Windscribe add-on is running in Firefox, the WiFi icon becomes a ? (question mark).  It is imperative that the WiFi icon on the desktop screen is back to normal and add with a new 'Key' icon on the desktop whenever the  windscribe-cli   is running in Fedora 30 as describe below.  The colour of the Windscribe icon in Firefox will show the browser client status.Test 1)Power down Router only and then power Router up.Test 2)Main power supply down.  Router is down, but the Laptop is running on battery power.In both Test 1 and Test 2, after desktop connection established, Firefox VPN reconnect again.However, the Laptop desktop VPN tunnel remains disconnected.  Users must run 'windscribe connect FR' to establish a VPN tunnel to a France exit point.It is imperative that a Fedora 30 desktop must have a Windscribe security icon, like a 'Key Symbol' at the top right corner of the desktop screen to tell users that the Desktop is either connected or disconnected to a VPN exit point.  Cisco IPsec-based VPN and SecurityKiss OpenVPN both have the 'Key Symbol' on the Fedora desktop screen whenever the VPN tunnel is connected.It is desirable to have the Desktop automatically re-connected to the last VPN exit point as soon as the Desktop establish connection to the Home Router, very much like Firefox automatically reconnect to the  browser last VPN exit point perpetually,  as users may forget to reconnect the Desktop.For both Test 1 an Test 2, Firefox could connect to a new exit point and not the previous exit point.  It is desirable that Firefox remember the last connected exit point and establish all new connections as such in manual mode.The above three inclusions will improve the VPN connectivity by a mile.--------3 days ago reviewDo as described as a VPN like my IP address is one in Germany when I selected the virtual location as Germany.  Although I did not checked using tools for the extra features like ad blocking, etc., I trust that Windscribe state it as it is.Another plus is that Windscribe did not guide, force, misled or use sinister ploy in getting users to do unnecessary or unwanted upgrade.So far my experience with Windscribe is satisfactory and smooth.  Hopefully this add-on will keep on improving and will not degrade in the future.  Then Windscribe will always have a place in my Firefox in every of my new Fedora about every six months.

It does a bunch of stuff. I love Windscribe and think it's a great option for a light-use VPN.That being said, it is just better to get the desktop version of the app instead. The only way I would justify choosing the extension over the desktop app would be if you were using a portable version of Firefox. Otherwise, get their desktop application.Secondly, I was having an issue where Firefox was starting up and then not loading my home page (www.google.com). At first I blamed it on uBlock, but then I did some debugging and found that this extension blocks the first page from loading when Firefox starts. My guess is it has something to do with either the extension refusing to initially load the page, or if Firefox doesn't want to load a page on startup until all extensions are loaded. Either way, I'd rather remove the extension than use a different browser. :(Edit: After reading further reviews, it has been made clear by Windscribe that they have only put priority on the Chrome extension and have not been updating this problem despite its being reported on their subreddit.Edit 7/7/19: While I'm not acquainted with the add-ons rollout system, I feel that three months does not qualify as soon.

I have been using this application a lot, specially to bypass some service limits for example those natural voice text to speech as you often, i only get a fixed amount of minutes for free.  If that happens 1 click on a button and not even 1 to 2 seconds later i can resume with what ever i was doing.  I basically do not use this application that much so the amount of free Gigs i get per month are well enough for me.  Most VPNs ask a lot of money, give you free but very limited use (like 1 IP), and often those servers are as SLOW A F..  as basically everyone that is using that application is using that 1 free IP address.  Not with Windscribe !!  Every IP i connect to is almost instantly connected and there is barely NO noticeable difference in my internet responsiveness.

This is my normal connection speed without Windscribe on and pinging the closest server to me. http://prntscr.com/n000byNow lets put this to the test with Windscribe  on again pinging the closest server to me. http://prntscr.com/n0021a Now i would not recommend using a WS server that is on the other side of the world for gaming as you will see my ping is high and my upload speed is low.. I had a small loss of around 4 to 7 Mbps on download speed. I actually wanted to do 1 more test that to the same server as before but with a relay via France with WS.   Damn speed tester failed twice due to a firewall error.  ? Not the problem of WS but the speed tester. Ill stop it here as i am flying through my WS Gigs like a stoned hippy xD   But overall i am very very satisfied with the amount of data you get monthly from WS for free and also the amount of quality.  I experience almost NO loss on speed on download at all does not matter what server i connect to.  Though i do lose almost all of my upload data.  But some other VPNs i tried disabled you internet for some time or required you to restart the pc. They where very limited and or cost a lot of money.  Windscribe basically gives me TOP quality for free and enough Gigs to chew on. Before i run out i will be topped up with the next month free data.   There is absolutely NO other VPN that i have seen so far that gives me this much data and quality and 0% headaches installing and using it.  Switching IPs is child's play with one click of a button. And my internet stays connected 100% of the time without any outages whatsoever  !!!   i will even go so far to saw that i can completely not understand at all that there are people out there giving this application a lesser score then 5 stars. I seriously can not rap my head around it. Those people must probably never have used any other VPN AT ALL.  Because other VPNs i used that where free are nothing more then a pain in the ass, long installments, and often blackouts meaning my internet connection would drop every so many minutes for a couple of seconds as the server crashed and i had to wait before it connected again.  If you see the Windscribe VPN ! Just stop looking further guys because these people give you so much quality, there is basically no other free VPN that will top this.

Windscribe quick enough for me too, although it doesn't have ipv6 yet. It does occasionally slow down, but overall the speed has remained constant and good for me. This VPN apparently only showed up in 2017 also, but from what I've read there is a plan to eventually implement the IPV6. Between the plugin and the Windows program, the IPLeak site seems to pull up alternate credentials for the IPV4, so I must assume everything works as it should. The program also allows you to tell it of an alternate web or socks5 proxy if you use something separate to send your connections through outside of the VPN itself. After first installing the program, I did have issues with the adapter disconnecting, but not able to connect back. I had to disable the adapter for Windscribe and then re-enable it in Networks and Sharing to get it to work right and I haven't had issues since. Having that go bad though, If I remember right, causes no web pages to load if it's having complications. I only experienced the problem once, so I don't quite remember how it was like.

The limitation of *what* it could store was much more serious: secrets like crypto tokens or credit card numbers, equally important, didn't fit the mnemonic pattern scheme, and therefore couldn't be stored safely in a plain text file. Instead, I resorted to multiple other ad-hoc systems, like pieces of paper or dedicated flash drives or even just memory, which I constantly dreaded would be leaked, lost or forgotten, a major source of anxiety for me.When I went looking for a solution (and I was really only trying to replace my password system), Bitwarden immediately stood out. First, my profession (and my passion) is developing open source software, and closed-source, proprietary solutions were immediately off the table. None of the other remaining options checked off half the boxes boxes Bitwarden did, especially availability on all my devices (even in the browser!) and Internet synch on a self-hosted server. Bitwarden even checked off boxes I didn't even know I had, like automatic password filling inside the browser AND in Android apps. Bitwarden was clearly the top choice. I spent about an hour switching over, installing the Firefox extension on my Linux laptop and the Android app on my phone, and migrating some of my most-used passwords.My life has never been the same since. Managing passwords is now almost effortless no matter which device I'm using, and no longer limited to the old mnemonic system. I didn't initially realize Bitwarden could also help remember so many other secrets, like credit cards, identities, GPG and SSH keys, API tokens and more, eliminating all my ad-hoc systems and with them, those feelings of dread and anxiety.

There's notably less feature bloat as well. It does what it's supposed to do and doesn't stretch itself thin.Tip #1: At first glance it may seem like there's not an auto-fill feature for this addon on Firefox, but you can enable it in the experimental features tab.Tip #2: My migration with LastPass mostly went without a hitch, but there were a couple sites using certain characters that didn't move over friendly.

Currently I am on the fence over detection of changed passwords/missed registrations since thats a huge pro for me. I'd give this 3 stars if it were not for the open-source factor which is  a huge security improvement in password management.

If you want to use a Yubikey, but then fall back to Google Authenticator, you can. Unlike Lastpass, where it's one or the other, something almost none of the other services I use 2fa with seem to restrict.I'm giving Bitwarden a try as Lastpass drops the ball on Firefox support.It's very clean, and quick. Parts of the interface are clunky (when you edit/save a new login, the giant green bar indicating that YAY YOU SAVED covers up ALL the useful buttons in the interface and doesn't time out nearly quickly enough, forcing you to click the X even to perform a simple task that shouldn't involve the notification.)It's not quite as good at detecting login pages and offering to save logins as Lastpass. If you ever need to toggle away to, let's say, copy a Authenticator code the extension completely closes and you have to re-type everything, even if you were in the middle of adding a new login. So even if you're only half-done, make sure to save even if your new entry is incomplete.It seems to especially fail to capture new logins if you have two-factor authentication enabled for your accounts (which really, you should, right?)It would be nice to create a folder/category for your login in the very same screen that you create a new login. It's clunky to create a login, then toggle over to settings, create a folder, then toggle back over to your vault, and finally assign the login a folder.The extensions don't sync automatically, or don't sync very often. Which means changes in your vault or in another browser don't sync until you manually click a button. That's an extra step that seems unnecessary.That said, I went ahead and paid for Premium even if I don't plan on switching away from Lastpass.

THIS IS A KNOWN SECURITY ISSUE AND IRONICALLY ONLY APPLIES TO PAYING CUSTOMERS. SINCE LASTPASS HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THIS ISSUE, NO ATTEMPT TO RESOLVE THE PROBLEM HAS BEEN MADE. THIS TOGETHER WITH A LACK OF TRANSPARENCY IN THEIR ISSUE MANAGEMENT RATES THIS AS 3 STARS AT BEST. THE remainder of the review relates to usability and is based on Lastpass's own publicity which given some of their representations at the time of this review regarding Yubikey being false, should be taken with that fact in mind. Lastpass is probably one of the more intuitive password managers on the market at the time of writing with integration into the widest number of websites and available on the widest number of platforms of all the consumer focussed password / identity management solutions. Security applications have for the most part been devoid of interfaces that make it simple for the end-user to use, or for the most part even understand, so in many ways LastPass's user interface is the main reason for its awards and subsequent user base. Functionally the range of features that come with Lastpass are impressive, if a little daunting for someone who has not seen its evolution as a piece of software and it can feel as though if you used all the features and functionality it contains \u2013 it can be used to keep secure notes and has multiple templates for recording other types of sensitive data besides passwords for websites \u2013 then you would be relying on a basket that would be holding a lot of heavy eggs. Templates include SSNs, WiFi Passwords, Bank accounts, payment cards, Insurance Details etc. and has the funtionality for creating your own templates (I created one for storing GPG Keys and another phone IMEIs among other things), that it really can feel that you could be left very exposed to identity theft if an exploitable security hole went unpatched. There is, as with all password managers, an issue that is core to single password information vaults. Your LastPass password may the the last password you'll ever need but it's also the only password you must never ever forget. Or divulge. And it needs to be good enough that it's not easily guessable.  For all these reasons I believe it's critical that some form of two factor authentication is used in addition to a strong password. The second authenticator can be hardware, e.g. software like Google Authenticator which generates a pseudo-random number generator app creates a new 6 digit authorisation code every 30 seconds. (Lastpass offer their own app for generating these numbers). It's why we all should have at least two front door keys (and not keep one under the flowerpot!) However the Achilles heel that all Vault based security apps struggle with: To ensure that only you can access your data also means that as there is no means of opening the vault if you forget your LastPass password, or lose the only source of authenticating you as the authorised user. LastPass have attempted to resolve this problem with a form of escrow that grants user nominated individuals access to the Vault in the event that the primary user is unable to input their password. I understand it is there primarily to help the family in circumstances where they need to take over management of the user's affairs. but the solution has a \"tacked on\" feel to it. Lastpass has made a strong commitment to ensuring their offering is secure which can be found on their website. Of all the password managers on the market I have found it to be the best and rate it highly, recommending it frequently. That said there are parts of the functionality which novice users and those who aren't IT literate do find it frustrating to use.

I have to trust reviews from people in the crypto/hacker/coding community, etc. who can analyze the code and/or hack the \"system\" and find vulnerabilities. From the research that I've done LastPass is a good option...the best that I've found.Usability: LastPass is frustrating!! It doesn't do anything very well. When creating a new account it's weak. In my experience, most of the time it doesn't even \"see\" that you're singing up for a new account, so I have decided to open the LastPass Vault, click on the + (plus symbol) and create the account step-by-step. Even doing this is somewhat frustrating: right-clicking in the password field to generate a password forces you to mouse to the bottom of that dialog, click Generate Password and then mouse down to select Generate Password and then select your options.MANY times I relied on LastPass to know that I am signing up for a new account and have regretted it because it either doesn't see/know what I've input into any of the fields and/or I have to go back to the site and select \"Forgot Password\" or whatever because LastPass effed up! Makes you feel like an idiot.After LastPass has the correct user name(s) and password(s) in its database it still doesn't work most of the time for me. For example, I open a site and the logon dialog appears. My wife has one account and I have another account. LastPass often won't even recognize the site (the same URL that is in its database including what's after the slash, e.g. https://www.xyz.com/login).Often LastPass will post and indicate that it recognizes the page you've loaded. I guess, you're supposed to be able to click on the LastPass icon and the login options are supposed to post (e..g. my wife's credentials and my credentials) and then click on one and it will enter your credentials. Most of the time I have to open the LastPass Vault and copy and paste the information  back onto the login page.Trying to login to leave this review took four times, i.e. my wife's credentials posted and my credentials posted. I selected my credentials three times and LastPass never entered them. I opened the vault and copy and pasted my user name and password.Conclusion: if LastPass is as secure as the reviews I've read it's worth the frustration.

Alot of Apps won't let you now, including Mozilla, unless you root, which I have done before, and it does not always work. Mozilla is a very big app on my cell and takes up alot of space and always had it on my SD card, but now they screwed with that too so you have to put it on internal memory only.

And the security is top-notch.  Everything is encrypted LOCALLY, on your PC--Lastpass's servers never see your actual data.Try it.  You'll wonder how you ever existed on the web without it.", "Works with more sites for me than paid Roboform did, for free!Well behaved toolbar button.I like the encrypted online \"vault\" for sync and as a backup for hundreds of bits of info that I would die if I lost with a crashed/lost/stolen notebook. Thanks!", "I have not installed any of these yet, but have been seeing users and the developers go back and forth about this product.  Here's how I see it.Plus: Sharing passwords.  This is important!  To those who don't like it, don't do it!  You don't have to share your data!  But the fact is, I'm the one who sets up all of the accounts and passwords on my wife's laptop and mine and I use the same info on both, since the purchases are made from the same bank account and are sent to the same address!Negative: I don't like the idea of sending all of my data to any one server.  Users these days spend a lot of extra time finding apps that won't do that.  And let's face it, if someone can write your security software for your servers, then someone can hack it and since you advertise that you have all of our data in one place, you're a target for hackers and it happens all the time!The thing is, we don't know what can happen with it once all of it leaves our computers and goes to someone elses, lock, stock and barrel and that is quite different than a company's server being hacked and only losing one piece of our info, for that one web site.And to address the comment about your company being sold one day, if a company does buy this one, while they may not be eager to harm what the company does, there are a lot of stupid people who buy companies and radically change things and hose it all up.  Or they are the type that thinks something new is automatically better and try it and there goes our security!And the developer said that if this happened, it would be closely watched.  BY WHOM???  YOU'RE GONE!!!  And the truth is, you're not going to announce it before hand so we can jump ship, because that would be a condition of the sale and it would hurt your chances of selling the company to someone anyway.  And yes, it would require an update to change the security on us, but so what?  They'd offer it as an enhancement and so, we'd think it was an improvement, not knowing what has changed and just download it and then its too late!  After all, they wouldn't tell us it's going to be bad for us. :)Negative: I don't see where this app has the ability to store and pull up receipts and to a pinhead like me who is constantly trying to remember who I bought something from and when, this is a nice feature, especially since I can never find my paper receipts either! :)So anyway, that's my take on it and I think, or at least I hope, that it sums up what people are going to great lengths to try to say to other users and to the developers.  And both sides can argue with these points, but they are facts.  They may not happen, but yes, they could, no matter how good one thinks their security is.So I hope this helped to sum up what folks are saying.  I also think that it doesn't make sense for any users to go off all crazy about \"what a scam\" it is, etc..  If they are telling you what they're doing, then by definition, it cannot be a scam. :)  You have a choice.  You are informed.And for the developers, I don't think it makes sense to keep talking about your security being so great, because your type of security has been hacked before and will be again and you are a target spot, since your software is known to collect all of a users info, so it's like one stop shopping for hackers!  I'm not blaming you for that.  I'm just saying that realistically, if someone can write the software that secures you, then that means that there's also someone who can hack it!  And so, unless your security was written by God, you are not truly secure! :)", "fantastic!", "wreaks havoc in your toolbar settings!lastpass,this add-on has always been one of my must-haves but then lately it causes conflicts with my toolbar settings!everytime i restart firefox, all my other add-ons buttons (e.g. read it later,speed dial, personal menu) are missing except for the lastpass compact toolbar button!!its like its been PERSISTING to stay beside the searchbar instead of just being OBEDIENT and STAY in the personal toolbar like i wanted to!its my DECISION to put it in the personal/bookmarks bar and lastpass should RESPECT that.yes its SMART, but it should not act like its got a mind of its own and push all other buttons out of the way because that would be so DUMB!i suggest that lastpass compact button should be in the customize window (like every other add-ons) so we USERS will FREELY decide exactly where it should stay.another thing: pls make a toggle button for the lastpass sites sidebar like the rest of respectable firefox add-ons.thanks and pls improve!", "wreaks havoc in your toolbar settings!lastpass,this add-on has always been one of my must-haves but then lately it causes conflicts with my toolbar settings!everytime i restart firefox, all my other add-ons buttons (e.g. read it later,speed dial, personal menu) are missing except for the lastpass compact toolbar button!!its like its been PERSISTING to stay beside the searchbar instead of just being OBEDIENT and STAY in the personal toolbar like i wanted to!its my DECISION to put it in the personal/bookmarks bar and lastpass should RESPECT that.yes its SMART, but it should not act like its got a mind of its own and push all other buttons out of the way because that would be so DUMB!i suggest that lastpass compact button should be in the customize window (like every other add-ons) so we USERS will FREELY decide exactly where it should stay.another thing: pls make a toggle button for the lastpass sites sidebar like the rest of respectable firefox add-ons.thanks and pls improve!", "lastpass,this add-on has always been one of my must-haves but then lately it causes conflicts with my toolbar settings!everytime i restart firefox, all my other add-ons buttons (e.g. read it later,speed dial, personal menu) are missing except for the lastpass compact toolbar button!!its like its been PERSISTING to stay beside the searchbar instead of just being OBEDIENT and STAY in the personal toolbar like i wanted to!its my DECISION to put it in the personal/bookmarks bar and lastpass should RESPECT that.yes its SMART, but it should not act like its got a mind of its own and push all other buttons out of the way because that would be so DUMB!i suggest that lastpass compact button should be in the customize window (like every other add-ons) so we USERS will FREELY decide exactly where it should stay.another thing: pls make a toggle button for the lastpass sites sidebar like the rest of respectable firefox add-ons.thanks and pls improve!", "Most useful extension I have right now.", "This is a major ripoff!!!

Nothing or very little to protect the potential users of the service from LastPass and/or their contractors (rogue employee) or the effects of potential hijack of the service.  Given the type of service provided, the Terms of Service should be very explicit to: (i) what information is Lastpass storing and in what format/standard; (ii) what is the service essentially provided by Lastpass (e.g.: \"Lastpass will only store your passwords in an encrypted format to which only you have the key.  The perfomance of this service and the information available to Lastpass or its contractors are verified by YYY and traceable to ZZZ, etc.\"; (iii) Lastpass provides IDtheft insurance up to $$$$.; (iv) once a user abandons the service, the removal of their information is certifiable by third parties.", "I really like this addon.

This is simply not true; as far as i know, the stored passwords are protected by encryption, and this code is released by Mozilla to trusted individuals for specific purposes... such as creating an extension.  However, there are appz out there that can attack/crack your stored passwords and tell you what they are if you \"lose\" your master password -- but really these are illegitimate programs.

Doing this for every site is not possible... Enter LastPassThis extensions lets user create the STRONGEST, 'unbreakable' passwords, and manages them tightly... No one, even yourself has to know ANY of your passwords, just one master one (and you better make that one strong) and your login details are sent encyrpted, then sent over SSL (Double Encrypted).  they are held remotely in an encypted form, so even if someone hacked their servers...

You just need to check some stuff like :1) That lastpass never send your master password to their servers2) That it is really your master password that is used to encrypt the sensitive information3) That the information always leaves your computer encrypted...Then if you know something about encryption or if you read some stuff (lastpass has a nice FAQ pointing good external references) you will understand that without your master password your encrypted data on lastpass servers is useless.But once again I say to all of you, don't take my word (or lastpass), just check it by yourself.If you need any help, post in the forum post of the above link that I would be glad to point you some directions on how you can independently run some tests.", "At first, I was hesitating to use lastpas.

But even  i f  they are encrypted, one have to send you the not encrypted passwords as well as the 'master password' to encrypt them.This way every traffic listener on the web with enough knowledge can catch this data... and what kind of 'security' is this? You need to receive the not encrypted passwords to be able to encrypt them and... you know the master password... of course you also know the encryption algorithm ... what else can one offer you to access every single password (this method you call trustworthy???)?

No, man, I'm not paranoid, but you seem to think, all people trust in strangers... may be some do - I WON'T.Would YOU give all your passwords to me, if I'd tell you, they will be encrypted? You know what? There are indeed methods for such a kind of storage on a server, BUT before one single password leave a machine, it has to be encrypted LOCALLY with an algorithm AND password, which WILL NEVER leave the local machine.

Many times the log in for \"signing up\" is not the actual \"log in\". To retrieve the \"secure password\" generated for the actual \"log in\" can't be done.

I only have a couple bank account passwords that I don't save into it because I don't visit them that often.

Its basically like foxmarks but for passwords. You can even log into the website to view passwords if your on a friends or public computer. Also, I tried foxmarks to save passwords but it lacks the powerful auto fill and robustness that lastpass has. I have to give the creators serious credit. This is relatively new and I am constantly getting new updates that impress me more. They must be pretty determined to make this add-on successful. I made a request for a feature awhile back and it happened (multiple profiles). I also emailed them about having a problem saving my meebo password and recieved a reply the next morning! Meebo is a special case to save your passwords because it uses ajax. You just have to type your info in and BEFORE logging into and click save fill form data, then click to log in. Then next time it auto-fills your login. Other small tweaks I prefer is selecting the option to place the auto-login pop-up on the bottom and making the lastpass icon smaller to make it a little less obtrusive. (I also feel like this should be the default. . . but thats just my opinion.) Last side note, if you use firefox profile manager (ie '--profile manager' or '-P Bob') it installs last pass onto all your profiles. Its not a big deal because you can just uninstall it from the profiles you don't want it to use.Thanks lastpass!p.s.

However I will use it to store logins to non important sites that I want to be able to access from anywhere.However, aside from the trust/security problems with the extension, technically it is perfect and is everything I have ever dreamed of in an online password manager. It works just like the Firefox default manager, except it's stored online. You guys are legends for pulling this off!!!===end of review but I continue with a more detailed report of the entire setup of the service on my pc, including the install and config of this extension==However while the final product is perfect, the install process and initial configuration is scary as %#$@. They get me to download an exe from their site when I could have just used this xpi!!! They then talk about removing my passwords from my computer and disabling the Firefox manager!!! Regardless I made a backup of everything as it was apparent they would try to do things without my permission.https://lastpass.com/faq.php#whynotbuiltinAfter reading this I was keen to see if they in fact could do as they say... but no, they asked for my master password, to which of course I hit cancel and then cancel again when it asked a second time. They then tell me that they can't find anything... HA! Stupid assuming FAQ entry!!! I was hoping that because I had not given them access to the passwords, they would not do anything stupid like disable it anyway or delete the file, but their phrasing in the dialog boxes wasn't at all comforting. Thankfully they left everything as is because I did not give them this password, however I then had to install this extension which for some reason was not added after the initial install (which now knowing about this extension, I wish I had never run).I install the extension and they yet again ask to grab all my passwords from firefox and I say \"no\" yet again. Then I go to a simple site that I don't mind giving away the password for. The default FF master password box pops up as there is a login form. I enter it and it auto fills my the login details like norm. However as soon as I submit the for that's when Last Pass kicks back into action... it comes up with a branded version of the \"Save this password?\" bar that firefox normally uses and allows me to save the password to their service. Perfect!!! I love this, it's great!!!Once set up using the method I described (starting at the xpi, not the exe) this should be a great way of keeping everything backed up on your own pc, but at the same time, making it accessible via their online service. Also it means that they are never actually reading from your password manager, so you don't have to trust that they won't automatically send everything to their server and won't go and delete everything either. This is how it should be, I want them to see what I want them to see, not everything like they are trying to do. Also why the hell should the password be deleted from my system? That is a big mistake!!! What if their company goes bust and they can't afford to keep everything running. There go all my passwords in one go because they deleted them from my system and now can't afford to keep the servers running so I can get my stuff back. Or it could be a fire or flood or data corruption or anything. This is my data, so they shouldn't be auto deleting it!But yeah if you follow my setup path and only use it to store non critical passwords until they fix the trust issue I mentioned, then you should be fine and this should be quite a useful extension.", "The first free tool that is really is comparable to Roboform in functionality! Its like roboform but totally mobile - one thing I have to complain: I dont see ANY use for the explicit \"SHARE\" function in your passwordlist. It is just disturbing!

When I switch from group A to group B and then right away close active tab in this B group - I am switched back to A group. That works like it should be: last active tab becomes that one in A group. But if I switch back to group B again - then any active tab from A \"moves\" to group B.Disabling your addon resolves this issue.", "", "", "This addon lets you correct one of Firefox's bigger usability problems: the unpredictability of which tab will be selected when you close a tab. It also does so with the minimum necessary permissions, which in an age of spying browser addons is something to appreciate.Firefox keeps some internal info about which tabs are 'children' of 'parent' tabs, and depending whether you have clicked around in the tab bar or not, may choose to activate some 'peer' of the closing tab rather than one adjacent to the closing tab. But this information is not communicated to the user at all, the tab bar appears to be just a list of tabs! I'm fairly technically literate and I find this behaviour stunningly confusing, I can only imagine how frustrating this must be to less technical users. I'm not even sure that this description of how it works is 100% right, and I've spent some time looking into it!In my opinion, Firefox's closing order for tabs without parent-child relationships (selecting the tab to the right) is also wrong. When you open a new tab, it is opened on the right. It only makes sense that closing a tab would select the tab to the left, taking you back toward where you began. The fault doesn't lie entirely with Firefox though, this is also Chrome's behaviour, and the Firefox team must feel much pressure to keep their interface consistent with the competition to make switching easy.But I digress. These are small user interface issues, but minor details like this can have major impact on the user experience. Kudos to the author for making this extension.The only flaw is that, when configured to select the tab to the left, there is a brief flash where the tab to the right is selected before switching to the tab to the left. I presume that this is due to a limitation of the current extension API, where the extension reacts to the tab closed event after the tab is gone and Firefox has already made its default next tab selection, and that nothing can be done to fix it. Unfortunate, but not a deal breaker!Users who care about tab opening behaviour are also encouraged to check out an about:config option added in Firefox 60, which positions new tabs to the right of the opening tab (instead of to the right of the current peer tabs, or at the end of the tab strip entirely):browser.tabs.insertAfterCurrent = true", "None of these add-ons works without activating the right tab when the active tab is closed.

Yes, much the same as every other review so far - I'm actually writing this review to let you know that you don't actually need to trust any external HTTPS service to handle this!Specifically, the Chrome version of DNSSEC/TLSA Validator, the extension you're clearly attempting to replicate, suffers from the same WebExtensions restrictions that modern Firefox does. Rather than trust an external service, however, they work around the issue through a WebExtensions feature called native messaging: a compiled binary is installed onto the system, which can do whatever it likes locally including make its own DNS queries, and then the WebExtension can ask that binary to check DNSSEC status when necessary.Yes, it's a little bit of a hassle to install the necessary binary in the first place, since the browser won't install it automatically, but it's much more secure than trusting any external service - and it's no different to how the Chrome version of DNSSEC/TLSA Validator works right now.I can confirm that Firefox supports this exact same approach, since I use several WebExtensions in Firefox this way (browserpass and bukubrow, specifically!). I don't know why the folks behind the DNSSEC/TLSA Validator haven't simply released a Firefox 57+ extension that uses native messaging, exactly like their existing Chrome extension, but it's definitely something you could do. :)", "I'm with bsiege:  I'm looking to replace CZ.NIC Labs' excellent DNSSEC/TLSA Validator.
